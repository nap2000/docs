Choices can be accessed from a question in the question panel.  They can also be accessed via the choice list panel. If
you change a choice list by accessing from a question it will change the choices for all questions that use the same list
of choices.

Adding
------

* Click on the **Add New Choice** button at the end of the list to add a new choice there.  
* Alternatively to add a choice somewhere else in the list click on the menu button at the left of one of the existing
  choices and select **add before** or **add after**.
	
Editing
-------

*  Edit the choice value, label or display name directly.  
*  To edit media take the same approach as editing a property in questions except there are only two properties **Choice Text** and
   **Media**.  Select the properties menu item initially labelled **Choice Text** and change it to **Media**.
   
Moving
------

Click somewhere in the choice where there is not an editiable field and drag the choice to where you want it to appear in the list.

Deleting
---------

Select the menu option to the left of a question and then select **delete**.
