Cases vs Assigned Records
=========================

Sometimes we talk about a rocord assigned to a user as a "case", however to be a proper case a survey needs
to have a status value that can be marked as closed. Here are the differences in more detail.

Assigned Record
---------------

A record can be assigned to a user.  It will then appear on the task tab of fieldTask or WebForms and the user
can update it multiple times until it is unassigned.  This is how cases are commonly used in practice.  A person 
might be assigned a criminal case and they manage that until it ends or is reassigned to someone else.

A Case
------

A true case has a status that can be set to closed.   This means a record can be an open or closed case whether or 
not it is assigned to anyone.
