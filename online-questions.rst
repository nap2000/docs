Adding
------

#.  Click on a type in the question type toolbar. This will add that type of question to the very end of the survey.
#.  Drag a question type from the question type tool bar over a blue add question button. This will place the new question where you drop it.
#.  Click on one of the blue add question bars. This will create a text type question at the location you clicked. 
    You can then change the type of the question by clicking on the question type icon next to the question name
	
Editing
-------

*  Change the **type** of a question (ie text, integer etc) by clicking on the question type button that is to the left of the question add
   dialog box will then be shown allowing you to select a new type.  If data has been submitted to the survey since you added the question
   then there may be some restrictions on changing the type.
*  Change the **name** by editing its value directly. Note once data has been submitted for a question then editing the name will be disabled.
*  Change the **Label** by editing its value directly.  The label will be changed for the currently selected language.
*  For select type questions edit the choices by clicking on the **Edit Choice** button.

Question Properties
-------------------

The XLSForm editor (:ref:`xls-editor`) has a large number of columns where you can specify the properties for a question
such as relevance, appearance and constraints.  By contrast the online editor allows you to select one of these columns at a time
for editing.  All the questions will then be shown on the screen with the value for the selected property visible.
