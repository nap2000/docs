Contacts
========

The contacts page can be used to review email addresses that you have sent notifications, tasks or mailouts to.  Each email address can be in 
one of 3 states, as shown by the status in the table:

*  New.  An email has been sent but the user has neither opted in, unsubscribed or subscribed. New emails sent to this address will be put into
   a pending state until the user opts in. 
*  Subscribed.  The user has opted in or subscribed and will receive emails.
*  Unsubscribed. The contact has **unsubscribed** and no further emails will be sent to them

New contacts can be added by selecting the **Add** button.  If you select a record in the table you can edit the name of the contact.

Contacts can also be added on the **Campaign** page or any time an email is sent to a new address from tasks, notifications or "Add User"..
