Question Properties
===================

The XLSForm editor (:ref:`xls-editor`) has a large number of columns where you can specify the properties for a question
such as relevance, appearance and constraints.  By contrast the online editor allows you to select one of these columns at a time
for editing.  All the questions will then be shown on the screen with the value for the selected property visible.
