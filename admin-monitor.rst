   Submission Details

Select "last (200)" to see details on the last two hundred submissions. If you have a lot of submissions or the problem happened a significnt 
amount of time ago then you can:

*  page through these submissions using the buttons labelled ">>>" and to get the previous 200 "<<<"
*  restrict the details to a single survey by selecting the project and then the survey
*  uncheck the status values that you are not interested in.  For example you may not want to see successful submissions so unchecking that
   will hopefully remove a lot of the unneeded details
