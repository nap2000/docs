   Modified Case

A version of the case for each survey!
--------------------------------------

Currently if a user has access to two data surveys in a bundle and they are assigned a case then two copies of the case will be downloaded onto their device
Both containing the same data but they will be opened by the different data surveys.

It is possible that this situation will not happen in the real world.  Users who complete cases on phones might only be given access to one of the surveys
in the bundle and hence will see only once case.

If this is a situation that you need to deal with then contact smap support with a description of why this will happen and we will implement an appropriate 
solution.
