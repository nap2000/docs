Reports
=======

To access select the menus **Modules** then **Analysis** then **Reports**

Click **Add Report** to create a report.  The supported report types are XLS and PDF.  Give the report a name to identify it.

A key difference between reports and simple exports is that a link to the report can be sent to someone who does not have an 
account on the system.  They can then click on the URL to download the latest data.

From the reports menu you can also select an action to run the report, edit it or delete it.
