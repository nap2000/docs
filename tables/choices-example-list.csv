matches,"search('locations', 'matches', 'region_v', ${region}","Searches locations file for all rows where the region_v column is the same is the answer to the ""region"" question"
in,"search('product', 'in', 'product_category', ${product_category})","Returns all products whose category is in the list of product categories that are selected in the ""product_category"" select multiple question."
eval,"search('product', 'eval', ""cast(#{age} as integer) > ${min_age} and cast(#{age} as integer) < ${max_age}"", 'eval')",Return all people whose age is between the values selected in the min_age and max_age questions.  Note #{name} refers to a column in the data that you are looking up.  The 4th parameter is ignored for an eval filter so I just set it to 'eval' again in this example.
eval and matches,"search('product', 'eval', ""cast(#{age} as integer) > ${min_age} and cast(#{age} as integer) < ${max_age}"", 'eval', 'region', ${region})","As for the eval example above but this time only return people whose ages match and are also in region the selected region.  Note You can always replace this ""double filter"" format with a single eval such as:  search('product', 'eval', ""#{age} > ${min_age} and #{age} < ${max_age} and ${region} = #{region}"", 'eval')"
