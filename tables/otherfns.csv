once,once(${age}),The value will only be evaluated once while the form is open.  This is useful for setting dynamic default values that you want to get an initial value but after that the value should be set by the user.
default,default(${age}),"The value will be evaluated every time the dependent questions change. In this example if the answer to the ""age"" question was changed then the value will be reset.
