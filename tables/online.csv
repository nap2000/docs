lookup,This function can be used instead of pulldata in calculations.  It takes the same parameters as pulldata. However the csv file is not downloaded.  This can be useful when you have very large reference files.,"lookup('hhdata','members','hhid_key',${hhid})

lookup_image_labels,"lookup_image_labels(picture)

This has no counterpart in offline mode.  It can be used to call AWS Rekognition service to identify objects in a picture. Use in a calculation.

The image must be a jpg file.

To make this useful for your project you would probably want to create your own AI tool to recognise patterns in data and ask the fieldTask development team to add that as a service.","lookup_image_labels(${a_picture})

get_image,"Download an image from a server.   This image can then be used as the default value for an image, video or audio question.
Use in a calculation to set an image as an initial value to a question.
","Use a select to identify a base image to be downloaded and then annotated.

1)	Select a picture to edit.  The value of the select is the URL of the image.
2)	In an image calculation: get_image(${image_select_question}).  This will download the selected image

Because of the way calculations are evaluated, when the user saves the form using the naive approach above will cause the modified image not to be sent.  Refer to the dynamic image examples in the examples for an approach that will work."""
