","Use a select to identify a base image to be downloaded and then annotated.

1)	Select a picture to edit.  The value of the select is the URL of the image.
2)	In a calculate have: get_media(${image_select_question}, ‘/main/image_show_question’).  This will download the selected image
3)	Have an image question with appearance of “annotate” and a calculation of ${calculate_question_name}.
