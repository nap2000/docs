"Modulus
Remainder",mod,"3 mod 2

Raise to the power,"pow(a,b)","pow(${width}, 3)

Returns ${width} * ${width} * ${width}"
Random number,"random()

Returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)","round((random()* ${number_children} + 0.5), 0)

Generates a random number between 1 and the number of children in the household. This can be used to select a child for further questions. (For examplle to select a child from a repeat group using the indexed-repeat() function:  indexed-repeat(${child_name}, ${children}, round((random()* ${number_children} + 0.5), 0)))

It can be combined with the position() function to display the name of the child that has been selected."
Round to a number of decimal places,"round(a,b)

Rounds the number a to the number of decimals places b","round(${weight_kg}, 2)

round(0.5, 0)is 1"
Sum of repeating group,sum(nodeset),sum(${weight})
Maximum,max(nodeset),Maximum value in a repeating group
Minimum,min(nodeset),Minimum value in a repeating group
digest,"digest(data, algorithm, encoding method)","digest(${name}, 'SHA-1')

Computes the hash of the data.  This is useful if you do not want to store sensitive information on the server. The hash value of the data can be used as an alternative non identifying standin for the entered value. You can use the appearance phoneonly on the sensitive question so that it is not stored on the server.

The options for the second parameter, algorithm, are 'MD5', 'SHA-1', 'SHA-256', 'SHA-384', 'SHA-512'.
The third parameter, encoding method,  is optional. By default 'base64' will be used.  The options are 'base64', 'hex'."
