To get to task select **Modules** and then **Tasks**.

Tasks can be assigned to a person in order to complete a blank survey or update an existing record.

Task Groups
-----------

Tasks are managed in task groups.   Task groups are placed inside projects hence surveys that can be assigned
have to be in the same project.  However the initial data for a task can come from a survey in a different project.

Task groups can be simple containers (Ad Hoc) in which you can create and manage tasks or they can have a **rule** that 
automatically creates tasks from submissions to a survey.
