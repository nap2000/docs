Email Tasks
===========

Tasks can be assigned to system users or to email addresses.  The latter do not require the user to logon to 
complete the task.  Instead they are emailed a link that contains a unique identifier which effectively 
acts as a user id and password for the task.  When the task is completed and results submitted the completing
user is identified as the email address.

.. note::

  Email tasks automatically expire after 30 days unless the option to allow multiple submissions has been
  selected.
