.. _complete_case:

Cases

A status question and the value of that status question that indicates a case is complete can be specified for a survey. Completed
records, that are not assigned to a user, are then hidden by default in the console although they can be shown if the "Include Completed Cases" option is selected.

(:ref:`case-management-config`)
.. _case_alerts:

Alerts
------

Alerts can be added to cases.  These are triggered a specified period of time after the case is first created. 
The alert is then shown in the console and can also be used to trigger notifications or escalations of the case. In 
the console you can view the current alert on a record in the table view and create a chart in the chart view to 
show a summary of current alerts.
