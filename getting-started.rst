Create an account on the hosted server
--------------------------------------

Using your web browser navigate to https://sg.smap.com.au
Click on the "register" menu and fill in the requested details.  You will need to enter your email address so that an email can be
sent with a link that you can use to set your password.  

Make sure to read the terms and conditions for use of the free server. 

Once you have set a password you can logon using your email address as your user ident and logon to the server.

Registering creates an "organisation" and within this organisation you can add additional users, projects and surveys. Only users
created by you in your organisation can access your data.
