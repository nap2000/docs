Create an account on the hosted server
--------------------------------------

Using your web browser navigate to https://sg.smap.com.au
Click on the "register" menu and fill in the requested details.  You will need to enter your email address so that an email can be
sent with a link that you can use to set your password.  

Make sure to read the terms and conditions for use of the free server. 

Once you have set a password you can logon using your email address as your user ident and logon to the server.

Registering creates an "organisation" and within this organisation you can add additional users, projects and surveys. Only users
created by you in your organisation can access your data.

.. note::

  Not all the menu options and features described in this document will be visible to all users.

Using the Server
----------------

Once you have logged on you can create surveys and manage your data collection. 

Navigation
++++++++++

The Smap server is divided into **modules** including Admin, Analysis, Edit and Tasks.  To navigate between modules**
select the **modules** menu and then the module you want to go to.  Within each module there will then be multiple functions
that you can access via the menu bar.

Your Profile
++++++++++++

On all screens the first menu option will be for your user profile.
