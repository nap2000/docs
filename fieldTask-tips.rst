Creating a shortcut
-------------------

You can create a shortcut on the home page of your phone to a specific form.  This will work like an app for that form.

1.  Find some space on one of the home pages of your phone.  Alternatively go into :guilabel:`Apps` on the phone and find some space there.

3.  Find the **FieldTask** widget and select it

4.  A menu will show all the available forms.  Select the form that you want to create a shortcut for.

5.  The shortcut will be shown on your screen.  You can move it using drag and drop and you can delete it in the same way you can remove any app from 
    which is by doing a press and hold and then dragging it to **Remove**.
