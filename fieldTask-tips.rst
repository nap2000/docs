Creating a shortcut
-------------------

You can create a shortcut on the home page of your phone to a specific form.  This will work like an app for that form.

1.  Find some space on one of the home pages of your phone.  Alternatively go into :guilabel:`Apps` on the phone and find some space there.

2.  **Touch and hold** in the space where you want to place the form launcher and select the :guilabel:`Widgets` button at the bottom of the screen.

3.  Find the **FieldTask** widget and select it

4.  A menu will show all the available forms.  Select the form that you want to create a shortcut for.

5.  The shortcut will be shown on your screen.  You can move it using drag and drop and you can delete it in the same way you can remove any app.
    That is by doing a press and hold and then dragging  the icon to **Remove**.

Saving Battery Life
-------------------

* Turn off wifi and bluetooth
  * Using the android menu go to **settings** and then **wireless and networks**
  * Unselect wi-fi
  * Unselect Bluetooth
* Turn off the GSM network by selecting airplane mode
* In the Mobile App Settings tab - un check **Enable Geofence**

Disabling the geofence feature is the only FieldTask specific battery saving method.  The others are general techniques applicable to any phone 
although we can assume that for the phones used for data collection in remote areas where you are concerned about battery life then it will be
fine to switch off networks until they are needed.  When the geofence feature is enable the phone continuously checks to see if it is within the
location specified for a geofence and this will use some batter power.
