Select questions have choices and you put these choices into the choices sheet then connect them to the question using a "list_name".

Select One or Select Multiple
-----------------------------

You can ask the enumerator to pick a single answer using a type of *select_one*.  Alternatively they can be allowed to pick multiple choices using 
a type of just *select*.
