Case Management
===============

A case management system is concerned with managing individual records of data that correspond to something or someone in the 
real world. Surveys are used to collect data and guidance can be used to provide services effectively while maintaining a focus
on individuals.

With case management we add process to the guidance and forms already in the users phones.  This enables the delivery of much 
more sophisticated services.  

An added benefit is that these case management systems generate a large amount of real time data data on what is happening
in the field which supports better and quicker analysis.
