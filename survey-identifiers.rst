Survey Identifiers
==================

.. contents::
 :local:
 
When you refer to another survey in a relevance or choice lookup you need to use its identifier.  Something like "s12_3455".  Unlike the survey's name
this will uniquely identify the survey that you are referring to.  The following tools can be used to help find and interpret this identifier.

Survey Lookup
-------------

If you are editing a survey that refers to another survey's identifier then you can select that identifier and click on **Tools** then
**Survey Lookup** to find the project and name of the referenced survey. 

Get Survey Ident
----------------

If you want to insert a survey ident into a pulldata function or similar, then you can click on **Tools** then **Get Survey Ident**.  In the
dialog use the tab keys to navigate down to the survey you want and then press the return key.  The survey identifier will be copied to the clipboard
and you can then paste it into the editor.
