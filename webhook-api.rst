Web Hooks
=========

.. toctree::

A web hook allows you to call a web service in an external system when an event happens on the Smap server.  For example when a submission is received
a :ref:`callback URL<callback-url>` that you have specified can be called with the results of that submission.  

.. _callback-url:

Getting the callback URL
------------------------

The external system you are going to call needs to generate the callback URL.  There are many tools such as 
`Zapier <https://zapier.com/>`_ that can be used to do this.  In this case when Smap calls the callback URL a Zapier workflow is started.
This can process the data and send it to one of the thousands of different applications that have interfaces to Zapier.

User name and password
++++++++++++++++++++++

Smap supports basic authentication of webhook calls.  Hence you can optionally add a user name and password.  Often this is not required as
callback URLs generally include a long sequence of random characters so as long as you do not publicise the URL it should be secure. For example here is a 
(slightly modified) callback URL generated by piped dreams:

  https://enz7wh0s1ifrtre.m.pipedream.net

Monitoring
----------

Calls and their status, successful or otherwise can be monitored on the ``Monitoring`` page in the Admin module.  Select a source of "Notifications" and
then specify ``Show`` as "last 200".

Data Submission Web Hooks
-------------------------

Adding
++++++

These web hooks are added on the notifications page which is in the tasks module. After clicking the ``Add`` button specify the target of the notification
as a Web Hook. You will then be able to specify the callback URL and optionally a user name and password.  The trigger of the notification can be set to:

*  Submission.  New results submitted to the server.
*  Task Reminder.  A task has not been completed within the allowed time.
*  Console update.  The data has been changed using the console.

Filtering
+++++++++

Notifications are for specific surveys.  You may also want to add a filter such as "${age} < 10", especially if you are receiving thousands of submissions per day.  
This can be particularly important if you are using paid middleware such as Zapier.  You don't want to filter out 90% of the requests in your middleware 
when you are being charged each time the workflow is initiated. Hence pre-filtering in Smap will save you money.
