Most questions only require an entry in the type, name and label columns of the "survey" sheet.  

.. Note:: 

  The exceptions are the select questions and the rank question which also require choices to be specified in the choices sheet.
  There are also some questions that require other columns to be completed in the "survey" sheet such as range, chart and 
  parent_form.

To add a simple question you need to specify the question type, its name and its label.  The label being the text that is shown 
to the data collector.
