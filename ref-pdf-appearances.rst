PDF Appearances
===============

The generation of PDFs from survey data can be styled using appearances in the survey.  Hence this reference section on styling PDFs is included here
even though it is not related to the collection of data but the viewing of it.  The online editor will guide you through setting appearances for PDFs
however here is the complete reference which will be useful if you are using the spreadsheet editor.
