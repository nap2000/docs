Organisations
=============

.. contents::
 :local:
 
Organisations are managed on one of the tabs of the users page.  To get to it select the menus; **Modules** then **Admin** then **Users**
then the **Organisations** tab.  Organisations can be used to compartmentalise work further than just using projects.  Each organisation
can have multiple projects within it.  The main value that organisations bring is that an administrator cannot move to a different
organisation unless they are given explicit permission to do so, either by an organisational administrator or the administrator who created
the organisation.

.. warning::

  If you have organisational administration privilege then you will see all of the organisations on the server listed on this tab.  Otherwise,
  if you administrator privilege you will see the organisations that you have created..
