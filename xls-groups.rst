Groups
======

Groups do as their name implies, they collect questions together into a group.  This has 2 purposes

1.  Allow a **relevance** to be applied to a lot of questions at once
2.  Show multiple questions on the screen at once

A group is defined using two question types.  A **begin group** that indicates the start of the group and an **end group**
that indicates its end.

All the questions between **begin group** and **end group** are within the group.

*  To add relevance to an entire group put it on the **begin group**
*  To put all questions in a group onto the same screen add **form-list** as an appaearance
*  In the special case where all the questions are select_one or select multiple and they refer to the same
   list then you can put them into a table setting an appearance of **table-list**
