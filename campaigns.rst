Campaigns
=========

The word "campaign" is taken from marketing.  In Smap it is where you manage the sending of email surveys to people to complete themselves.
Each **campaign** is associated with a single survey form.  This form can be sent once to multiple email addresses.  The recipient can complete
the form one time only.

To get to it select **Modules** and then **Campaigns**.
