Each enterprise can contain many organisations.  To manage and move between enterprises a user must
have the enterprise administration security group.

Adding a new Enterprise
-----------------------

On the user's page select the Enterprise tab.  You will only be able to see this tab if you have the enterprise 
administration security group.   Click on **Add Enterprise**, provide a name and select **save**.

Add an organisation to the new enterprise
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

  Users and projects are placed in organisations.  So you have to have at least one organisation in your
  enterprise in order to be able to add users there and to move yourself into that organisation.

#.  Select the Organisation tab and create the new organisation.  This organisation will be in your
    current enterprise.  Note this is optional you may want to move another existing organisation into your
    new enterprise.
#.  Click on the **Move** button for this new organisation and select the new enterprise
#.  Click **Save**

The new enterprise now has an organisation and you can move yourself, or other users and projects into it.

Moving a user between enterprises
---------------------------------

#.  Select the users tab
#.  Open the editor for the user that you want to move
#.  Select the new Enterprise
#.  Select Save

The user will now be in the new Enterprise.   They can still move themselves to organisations in different
enterprises if they have been given access to that organisation.
