The SMS numbers that can be used to create cases and record a conversation within a case are set up here.  Only the Vonage cloud platform
is currently supported as a source of numbers.  Details on how to get a number can be found here :ref:`sms-server-admin`

Adding a number is a two step process.

#.  Firstly the server owner has to add a number and associate it with an organisation.
#.  Then an administrator within the organisation can then configure the number to update a survey.

Add a Number
------------

As the server owner navigate to the users page and select the SMS tab.  You will see a button labelled "Add".
