Self Assign
===========

If the option "Self Assign" is selected for a task then then if that task is currently unassigned a user of FieldTask can assign themselves by doing a long
press on the task and selecting "Accept the task".

.. note::

  Self assign can be set directly on a task using the **Add Task / Edit Task** dialog.  Or it can be set in the task group which will
  cause all tasks automatically created in that task group to be set to "Self Assign".

The FieldTask user can also select "Reject Task" after a long press.  This will remove the task from their task list.
