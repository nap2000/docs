Formatting
==========

Guidance type applications can make extensive use of :ref:`formatting` in order to present information. It is also more likely
that a guidance application will use the FieldTask jump menu option.  This will present all the labels and values for a group
or form in a single screen and allow the user to select where they want to get more detail.  Colours and other formatting make this,
potentially long, scrollable view much more readable.

To create the dynamic text and its formatting, the text processing functions of calculations are used. (:ref:`text_functions`)
