Launch a Survey from inside a Survey
====================================

While completing a survey you may find that another survey needs to be completed.  You can launch this second survey, complete it, and then be
returned automatically to your location in the first survey.  In this way you can create surveys that include the logic to decide what other 
surveys need to be completed.

.. note::

  This capability is similar to entering a subform using **begin repeat** (:ref:`xls-repeats`).  However sub forms are included within the main 
  survey whereas here we are starting a completely different survey.

Linking data between the surveys
--------------------------------

When you launch another survey you may want to be able to connect the data between the launched survey and the survey that is doing the 
launching.  This is done by specifying a question that will hold a key from the other survey.
