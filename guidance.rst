Guidance
========

 :local:
 
In **guidance** type applications data is collected using forms in the same manner as M&E however the data is then used immediately 
to provide context relevant guidance / advice to the person being interviewed or the mobile device user.

Formatting
----------

Guidance type applications can make extensive use of :ref:`formatting` in order to present information. It is also more likely
that a guidance application will use the FieldTask jump menu option.  This will present all the labels and values for a group
or form in a single screen and allow the user to select where they want to get more detail.  Colours and other formatting make this,
potentially long, scrollable view much more readable.

Text Calculations
-----------------

To create the dynamic text and its formatting, the text processing functions of calculations are used. (:ref:`text_functions`)
