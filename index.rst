Welcome to the Smap documentation
=================================

:dfn:`Smap Consulting` (Smap) provides digital tools for a wide range of 
:ref:`applications` including Evaluation, Monitoring, Guidance, and Case Management.

Why Digital Data Collection?
-----------------------------

Digital data collection offers three key advantages over traditional methods:

* **Lower costs** - Reduce expenses associated with paper-based systems
* **Higher quality data** - Minimize errors and inconsistencies  
* **Faster insights** - Apply learning from your data immediately

How Smap Goes Further
---------------------

While all digital tools provide these benefits, Smap is designed to close the loop 
between data collection and action. Traditional approaches create delays between 
collecting data and implementing changes—sometimes weeks or months. Smap reduces 
this cycle time to days or even seconds.

This speed transforms how you work. Whether you're running evaluation cycles 
(Plan-Do-Check-Act) or research and learning programs, Smap lets you collect data 
and immediately use those same tools to implement improvements. The result: faster 
iteration, better decisions, and greater program impact.
